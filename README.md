# K-Means Clustering
 K-Means Clustering Cyber security course
K-Means Clustering Project

Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm using Python's scikit-learn library. The dataset used for clustering is sourced from ClusteringML.csv, and the aim is to identify natural groupings within the data.


Contents
ClusteringML.csv: The dataset used for clustering.
clustering_analysis.py: The main script containing the K-means clustering implementation.


Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following packages installed:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage

Load the Dataset: The dataset is loaded using pandas.

Select Features: Features for clustering are selected from the dataset.

Determine Optimal Clusters: The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, ranging from 2 to 10.

Apply K-Means Clustering: The K-means algorithm is applied with the chosen number of clusters.

Visualization: The resulting clusters are visualized using matplotlib.


Code Explanation
Data Loading:

python
Copy code
dataset = pd.read_csv("ClusteringML.csv")
Feature Selection:

python
Copy code
X = dataset.iloc[:, [3, 4]].values
Elbow Method: The within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) is calculated for different numbers of clusters:

python
Copy code
wcss = []
for i in range(2, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)
K-Means Clustering: The final model is fitted with the optimal number of clusters (5 in this case):

python
Copy code
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, init="k-means++", random_state=42)
y_means = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
Visualization: The clusters are visualized with distinct colors:

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(X[y_means == 0, 0], X[y_means == 0, 1], s=100, c="red", label="Cluster 1")
# Additional clusters...


Results
The output is a scatter plot displaying the clustered data points, color-coded by cluster.
